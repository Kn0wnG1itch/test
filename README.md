# Dev-Test Branch

## Overview

Welcome to the `dev-test` branch of the `test` repository. This branch is specifically set up for development testing and exploration of various GitHub features. The goal here is to experiment with different development practices, branch management strategies, and GitHub functionalities to refine your workflow and learn best practices.

## Purpose

The `dev-test` branch serves as a sandbox environment where you can:

- **Test New Features:** Experiment with new features or changes without affecting the main branch.
- **Explore GitHub Workflows:** Practice using GitHub's branching and merging features, pull requests, and other collaborative tools.
- **Document and Refine Processes:** Test and document effective development processes and workflows that can be applied to other projects.

## Usage

To make the most of this branch, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Create Feature Branches:** For each new feature or change, create a separate feature branch from `dev-test`. This helps in organizing and isolating different aspects of development.
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name dev-test
